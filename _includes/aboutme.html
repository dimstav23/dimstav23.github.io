      <p>
        I am a recent graduate at the field of Electrical and Computer Engineering.
        I completed my studies in National Technical University of Athens holding a 5 years’ degree followed by a 6 months‘
        diploma thesis (<b>Master in Engineering, MEng</b>). My diploma thesis was about algorithms for
        task-applications offloading in a two-tiered cloud computing environment.
        During my studies I have gained a very strong background in <b>computer science</b>
        and <b>software engineering</b> which helped me to successfully complete numerous academic projects.
        <br>
        <br>
        Currently, I am working at a company, called AKKA DNO GmbH, as a <b>Software Engineer Consultant</b>.
        My main responsibilities in my current position are the development of HMI Applications and Embedded C code
        development/analysis in the automotive sector.
        <br>
        <br>
        During my studies I gained experience as a <b>Backend Database Developer</b> at Travelosoft Ltd.,
        a company which produces software related to travel management.
        <br>
        <br>
        When it comes to me as a person, I am really keen on travelling. I love discovering the beauties of the world.
        I, also, never say "no" to a good movie or a nice concert. Apart from those, I enjoy watching football,
        trying different tastes from all over the globe and keeping myself up-to-date with state-of-art technology gadgets.
        <br>

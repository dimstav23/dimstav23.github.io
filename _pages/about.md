I am a PhD student at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) ([ICSA](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/icsa)) and at [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/) ([DSE](https://dse.in.tum.de/)), supervised by [Prof. Pramod Bhatotia](https://dse.in.tum.de/bhatotia/). My research interest lies in the field of computer systems design; precisely in the areas of operating, storage and hybrid memory systems. My current work mainly focuses on building secure and reliable systems incorporating the emerging [Persistent Memory Technology](https://www.snia.org/education/what-is-persistent-memory).

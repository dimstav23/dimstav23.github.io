I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [Systems Research Group](https://dse.in.tum.de/) at the School of Computation, Information and Technology (CIT), TU Munich, where I lead the [Trustworthy Systems Group](https://dse.in.tum.de/trustworthy-systems-group/). 
My research interest lies in the field of trustworthy computer systems design; precisely in the areas of operating systems, virtualization technologies and system software. My current work mainly focuses on building secure, reliable, verifiable and policy compliant systems leveraging modern Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) technologies.

Background
====
I obtained my Ph.D. in computer science in 2024 from the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) ([ICSA](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/icsa)), under the supervision of [Prof. Pramod Bhatotia](https://dse.in.tum.de/bhatotia/). My work during my PhD focused on building dependable (i.e., secure and reliable) systems incorporating the [Persistent Memory Technology](https://www.snia.org/education/what-is-persistent-memory). During my PhD, I interned at [Intel Labs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/overview.html) under the supervision of [Dmitrii Kuvaiskii](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PEhwLcwAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Mona Vij](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uZIel-4AAAAJ&hl=en).

Before that, I graduated from [School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en) in [National Technical University of Athens (NTUA)](https://www.ntua.gr/en/) in Greece. I conducted my [diploma thesis](http://artemis.cslab.ece.ntua.gr:8080/jspui/bitstream/123456789/13707/1/DT2018-0035.pdf) at the [NETMODE lab](http://www.netmode.ntua.gr/main/index.php) where I worked with [Dr. Marios Avgeris](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iTQI08AAAAAJ&hl=en), [Dr. Dimitrios Dechouniotis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vDIKhicAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Symeon Papavassiliou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qVvp2dEAAAAJ&hl=en). During my studies, I was working as Backend Database Developer at [Travelosoft Ltd.](https://travelsoft.gr/). Right after my graduation, I joined [AKKA DNO GmbH](https://www.akka-technologies.com/) as a Software Engineer Consultant.
